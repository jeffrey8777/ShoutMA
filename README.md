# ShoutMA
A martial arts with shouting on techniques as eoc mod for CDDA
Currently has Jigen-ryu and Bruce Lee JKD.
Jigen-ryu manual can be found in mansions with same spawn chance as barbaran montante, Bruce Lee JKD can be learned by choosing the Bruce Lee Fanboy hobby.

TO DO
1. Experiment more with EOC to see if a combo system is viable.
2. Test Bruce Lee JKD more to make it a fun viable and balanced role playing style.
3. Add other martial arts that uses shouts.(probably some fake wuxia style martial art or pro wrestling style with loudly shouting the technique name)
